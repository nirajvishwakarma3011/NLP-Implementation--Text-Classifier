# NLP-Implementation--Text-Classifier
This is an assignment for DS 207	Introduction to Natural Language Processing

This repository contains Natural Language Processing (NLP) implementations, including text classification models leveraging probabilistic methods, word embeddings, and feature-based approaches.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on **text classification** using different methodologies:
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** based on probabilistic inference.
- **Word2Vec embeddings** for capturing semantic relationships.
- **Bag of Words (BoW) Model** with logistic regression for classification.
- **Word2Vec-based Document Classification** using logistic regression.
